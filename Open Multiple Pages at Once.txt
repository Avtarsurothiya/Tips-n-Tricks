#Open_Multiple_Files_at_Once

We usually open same set of web pages when we open the browser in the morning. As an example a student may open College website, HackerRank portal, Jobs Portal and LinkedIn.
By using this method one can open all such pages at once which will save your time and will help you keep in mind what all places you need to visit.
Steps are provided below.

Step 1:
Create a new text file on your desk top.

Step 2: 
Edit it and write "@echo off" at first line

Step 3: 
Add all your webpages links with 1 line space to keep it clean.

Step 4: 
Add "start" before each link.

Step 5:
Now, save the file as "start.bat" and do not forget to select All files in file type while saving.

Now, when you double click on the saved file, it will open all mentioned links in your default browser.

Example:

@echo off

start www.google.com

start www.linkedin.com

start www.hackerrank.com
